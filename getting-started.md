### 3. Get Ready to Code in VS Code
1. Run `ls` to list all the files and folders in your current folder. You should see your newly cloned repo in the list.
2. Use `cd name-of-your-repo-here` to *change directories* into your newly cloned repo (make sure to type the actual name of the repo)
3. Open your newly cloned repo in VS Code using the `code .` command, if you have it installed. If you don't have it installed, there are also many other ways to do this, using the Finder, the Terminal, or opening directly in VS Code. Use the way is easiest for you.
4. Once your project is open in VS Code, open the Terminal in VS Code.

### 4. Run your Node file

1. In the terminal, use `cd` to navigate into the folder that contains the file you want to run
2. Run this command, replacing `fileName.js` with the name of the file you want to run: 

    ```bash
    node fileName.js
    ```
